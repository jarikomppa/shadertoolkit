# Shader Toolkit
A toolkit of public domain single-header libraries for shader-based opengl apps.

Getting shader-based OpenGL up and running can be a chore.

These single-header libs help with that.

The demos require glm and sdl2. The headers themselves don't really care,
although there may be some win32 stuff there (which is not exactly essential).

The headers are largely independent, so if all you need is a shader loader,
just grab that.
